# MS19 MP21 Math Community

Welcome!

Browsing on a desktop environment is recommended for best experience.

### Wait, do we even need this site?

Well, having a site that houses almost all the information crucial to the community is always a great thing to have. Among other things, this site stores course structure, announcements, syllabus, schedules, deadlines, developments and updates &mdash; well, almost everything the community need.

Visit here to check time table, exam schedules, midsem and endsem syllabus, timeline of events in the semester, deadlines and important annoucements made in the classes, grading schemes for all the courses &mdash; well you name it, it is here.

### Ok, who are the community mentioned above?

MS19 math majors refer to a group of 13 folks who landed up at IISER Mohali in 2019 and if things go well, will graduate together in 2024 with a BS-MS dual degree. MP21 folks, on the other hand, arrived at IISER Mohali in 2021 having obtained their B.Sc. degrees and are studying for an integrated MS-PhD degree.

This site unites them with all the information they will need for their stay at IISER Mohali.

### Fine, what really motivated all this?

A wise man once said ...

> *"Life is a difficult proposition."*

and he was right.

This site attemps to make life easier &mdash; for the community &mdash; by uniting them up with all the things they will need. This site strives to make life an easier proposition.

By the way, this site also houses a some of the most inspiring lines you will ever find in your life. The line you read above is a splendid example. Scroll down to the bottom of this page to read them. They might be helpful when midsems and endsems are close!

## Time Table

Well, experience tells us that time tables are very volatile and evolving &amdash; at least during the early days of the semester. As of now, this time table still stands.

## Most Inspiring Lines Ever

Now, the best part ...

> *"When you do mathematics, take a pen and a paper, and write here and there. All things will automatically follow from the definitions."*

I don't think I have heard of a better quote than this in my whole f\*cking life. This gives the secret (and the mantra) to proving anything in the universe.

> *"You have chosen this. You have to study 24x7."*

Highly motivational for fellow math majors. Everything is a consequence of your silly choices.

## About

Well, this site belongs to the MS19 and MP21 community. It was developed by Ronald, some fellow math major from the community, with an intention to provide easy and quick access to almost everything a math major may need in his/her short miserable life. Well, sort of.

Cheers! To the welfare of the community.
